## 🔍 Project Overview

The **Personal Security Dashboard** solves a common modern-day problem — the lack of centralized visibility and control over a user’s online authentication footprint. It lets users:

- Track JWT and OAuth2 tokens
- Monitor login history and devices
- Set up 2FA
- Revoke tokens or sessions
- Detect suspicious activity
- View security scores based on behavior

It’s ideal for privacy-conscious users, developers, and applications where authentication security is critical.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In today’s digital landscape, users log in across multiple platforms using passwords, JWTs, OAuth2 providers, and 2FA. However, they often lack:

- Visibility over active sessions/tokens
- Alerts on suspicious activity
- Breach exposure awareness
- A centralized place to manage security settings

This results in **security risks**, **delayed breach detection**, and **poor account hygiene**.
